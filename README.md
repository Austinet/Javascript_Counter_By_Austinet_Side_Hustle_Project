## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript
- Laptop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

I learnt quite a lot about Javascript while carrying out this task, how to add event listeners, how to target HTMl elements and modify their content using Javascript.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div> 
       <h2> 0 </h2>
  </div>
  
</div>
```
```css
h2 {
    font-size:20px;
}

```
```js
 var value=document.getElementsByTagname("h2")[0].innerHTML;

```
### Continued development

Now I have gotten a good background on HTML and CSS, and Javascript. I would learn more about frameworks like Bootstrap and Jquery
